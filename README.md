# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Overview

This project predicts customer churn (likelihood of customers leaving a service) using machine learning models. By analyzing customer behavior and demographics, the system helps businesses proactively retain at-risk customers.

# Features

Data preprocessing with feature encoding and scaling.

Handles missing values and categorical variables.

Trained with models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Performance evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost

# How It Works

Import and explore the customer dataset.

Clean and preprocess the data.

Train machine learning models to classify customers as churned or retained.

Evaluate model performance and fine-tune parameters.

Predict churn for new or existing customers.

Usage
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git

# Navigate to project folder
cd Customer-Churn-Prediction

# Install dependencies
